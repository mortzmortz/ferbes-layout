# Development Workflow

### Working with components

`Ferbes Layout` provides consumers with a suite of low-level layout components that
are powered by an underlying themed styling system.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Box Component">
    <>
      <Box>
        <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      </Box>
      <Box>
        <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      </Box>
      <Box>
        <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      </Box>
    </>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You’ll notice that each of these components don’t provide any surrounding
white space.

### Layout components

In order to distribute white space evenly between components, wrap sibling
elements in a [Stack](/?path=/docs/layout-stack--base) component with a custom
`space` property:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Layout Components">
    <Stack space="4">
      <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
    </Stack>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The `space` property is a responsive prop, which means that it can also accept
an array of values representing each breakpoint. For example, if you wanted a
smaller space below the first breakpoint and a larger space on larger screens:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Responsive Props">
    <Stack space={[3, 8]}>
      <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
      <Placeholder height={60} width={120} />
    </Stack>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Need responsive styles?

Previously, one of the main reasons for needing to create custom CSS was to
define responsive rules. The [Box](/?path=/docs/layout-box--base) component
makes this possible via responsive properties, which are provided as an array
of values—one per defined breakpoint.

For example, if we wanted to change the value for `display` responsively:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Responsive Display Prop">
    <Box display={['flex', 'block']}>
      <h4>Flex on small screen</h4>
      <h4>Block on large screen</h4>
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
